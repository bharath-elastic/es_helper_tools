Helper Tools for working with Elasticsearch

Requires Python3

Edit config.py to adjust elasticsearch host information to your needs. Authentication information if any will be requested, press return with no value if you don't have authentication.

If you have data in an index and you need to export the data in either json or bulk_json (format suitable for elasticsearch bulk operation) along with index settings this tool can help. 

use 'python export.py -h' for full usage information
